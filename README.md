## Projects Undertaken


#### National Robotics Championship

*[28/06/2015] – [30/06/2015]*

A robot was built that made movements according to the analyzed the gestures. This involved
programming of arduino board and interfacing of web camera and LED's.

#### Employability Skills Development

*[30/06/2016] – [25/08/2016]*

The course involved working with R Language and Oracle Database to handle Data. Advanced
algorithms like K-means clustering, Linear Regression, and Map-Reduce were studied. Oracle,
SQL and MongoDB databases along with implementation of triggers, pl/sql queries were
studied.

#### E-Commerce Web Development

*[30/07/2016] – [25/08/2016]*

A workshop about web development for an e-commerce website enabled one to learn about
Data handling the Data with SQL and architecture design along with front-end and back-end
connectivity. These modules were then Implemented using XAMPP as a local host server.

#### Mini Project - Society Master

*[26/09/2016] – [25/12/2016]*

The team project led by me consisted of three types of login systems which have limited access
for the chairman, the treasures and the residents. The chairman can add notices, resolve
complaints and add new residents to the society database. Whereas, the treasurer could only
maintain the dues of the society and residents of the society can add complaints, view the
pictures of the society events and check the pending dues if any. The project involved
programing in HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB.

#### Internship – Build the World

*[01/07/2017]-[30/09/2017]*

This technical internship involves development of web based platform for innovators, initiators
and volunteers to come together and organize well-managed campaigns The development of
the platform consisted of ReactJs for the front-end, Redux as middle-layer and NodeJs under
FeatherJS framework for the back-end. This internship has helped me to develop logic for
handling a real-time interactive platform thus evolving my skills to code in the above
mentioned STACK. My knowledge of MongoDB has also helped me to design schemas
necessary for this platform. Testing and debugging of a mobile based platform using React
Native.

#### Equity Forecast

*[01/06/2018]-[31/08/2018]*

The project involved prediction of stocks of ICICI Bank from year 2013-2017 using machine
learning(regression learning). Technologies used: Python,Quandl API(dataset),plotly,mongodb.

#### B.E Project - D-Bug

*[01/06/2018]-[31/05/2018]*

This project is developed taking in consideration the problems faced by Indian Grapevine
famers by a disease called “mealybug”, a group of 4 including me as leader. A mobile
application and a client server model is developed to recognize this disease using tensorflow
libraries and image processing for this purpose. We have used MobileNet as our machine
learning model and retrained it on the images we have acquired ourselves. We even worked
with ICARG(Indian Council of Agricultural Research Grapvenes) to understand the
pseudococcidae (mealybug) better.

#### FTP HUB

*[06/05/2018] – [15/06/2019]*

It is a file transfer and data manipulation system, by which we can copy files, email a report, execute store procedures, and manipulate data with different business logic.
