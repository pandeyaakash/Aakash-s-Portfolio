and volunteers to come together and organize well-managed campaigns The development of
the platform consisted of ReactJs for the front-end, Redux as middle-layer and NodeJs under
FeatherJS framework for the back-end. This internship has helped me to develop logic for
handling a real-time interactive platform thus evolving my skills to code in the above
mentioned STACK. My knowledge of MongoDB has also helped me to design schemas
necessary for this platform. Testing and debugging of a mobile based platform using React
Native.

famers by a disease called “mealybug”, a group of 4 including me as leader. A mobile
application and a client server model is developed to recognize this disease using tensorflow
libraries and image processing for this purpose. We have used MobileNet as our machine
learning model and retrained it on the images we have acquired ourselves. We even worked
with ICARG(Indian Council of Agricultural Research Grapvenes) to understand the
pseudococcidae (mealybug) better.
